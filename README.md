AirMenu
=======

Like Airbnb left side menu what we have used in [Tappal](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tian-pai-kou-dai-dan-gao-dian/id568621506?mt=8)

#What's the difference? 

1. Airbnb has two level menu, this demo offers one level menu, it's enough for us. 
2. Airbnb has better visual effect, if you want the same you need debug the perspective step by step.

#What do you need adjust if you apply in your project? 

1. You need customize `RMenuItem`, default `RMenuItem` has one tile and and one image.
